                        If a purpose of use arises that is outside the scope of the purposes of use, we will explain
                        the purpose of use to the person in question and obtain his/her consent before using the
                        information. <br />

                        (1) When required by law <br />

                        (3) Cases in which the provision of personal information is particularly necessary for
                        improving public health or promoting the sound growth of children and in which it is difficult
                        to obtain the consent of the person in question <br />
                        (4) Cases in which the provision of personal information is necessary for cooperating with a

                        agency or local government to execute affairs prescribed by law, and in which obtaining your
                        consent is likely to impede the execution of such affairs. <br />
